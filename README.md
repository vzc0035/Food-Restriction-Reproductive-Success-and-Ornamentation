This repository is in compliance with a manuscript in review. Please do not download this data and submit it as your own.

There are two main facets of this project:
1) Investigating the effects of developmental food restriction on reproductive effort, and:
2) Analyzing the effects of developmental food restriction on attractiveness and development of ornamentation.

The .txt files contain code used in R to analyze these data, separated into each question.
The .csv files are the data that were collected and used to analyze. Each .txt file should explain which files to use and when.
